# Data Ingestion

Data ingestion is the process of obtaining and importing data for immediate use or storage in a database. It involves taking data from various sources and moving it to a place where it can be stored and analyzed, such as a data warehouse.

There are two main types of data ingestion:

**Batch Ingestion:** This method involves collecting and importing data in discrete chunks at scheduled times. For example, a company might collect all of its sales data at the end of each day.

**Stream Ingestion:** This method is about continuously collecting and importing data as soon as it becomes available. This is often used for real-time data processing needs, such as monitoring website traffic or financial transactions.
